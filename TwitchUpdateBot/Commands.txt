*help - yeah.
*add <twitch username> - adds a user to subscriptions.
*remove <twitch username> - removes a user from subscriptions
*showsubs - shows a list of subscriptions
*change_alert_channel - Changes the default channel alerts appear on. (Owner only)

If bot doesn't send any alerts, despite subscribed users streaming it may not have the necessary permissions to do that. The default alert channel is the highest in UI view.
